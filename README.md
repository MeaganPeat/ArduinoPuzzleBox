# ArduinoPuzzleBox

<p>The goal of this puzzle is to manipulate and explore the box to turn on all the lights! The app uses various sensors and an Arduino to control 12 red LEDS. Every sensor must be utilized in some way to solve the puzzle.</p>

<h1>How it Works</h1>

<p>The project uses an Arduino Uno to control 12 red LED lights, and read from a tilt sensor, an ultrasonic distance sensor, a 2-axis joystick, and a push button, plus a lot of jumper wires (male-male, male-female, and female-female). All this is powered by a 9 volt battery with resistors to help protect the lifespan of the LED lights and the functionality of the button and tilt switch.</p>
